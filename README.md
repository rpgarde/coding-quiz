# Hi ðŸ‘‹ this is a 5 question coding quiz

## Features
* When you press start, a 60 second timer + 5 questions will get served to you with 4 options each
* Every time you pick an option, you will know whether it is right or wrong
* Every wrong answer deducts 10 points from the seconds left
* If you run out of time, the game ends and you're shown all the existing high scores

## My approach
* I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build this from scratch
* I used CSS's hover functions for the buttons to make them more intuitive
* For certain elements to appear / disappear based on certain options, I used the .style.display = "" functions in Javascript. 
* I used my knowledge of intervals (setInterval and clearInterval) to build the timer functions
* I used a mix of objects, arrays, and for loops to build the questions in an easily scalable way. This makes it very easy to just add more questions to the quizQuestions array

## This is the acceptance criteria I followed
* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    * Done. Start Game button starts a timer and serves a question.
* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    * Done. Each mistake subtracts from the clock.
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
    * Done. I made two different options
        * If score is above 0, it shows a standard response
        * If score is 0, it shows a GAME OVER response.
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and my score
    * Done, initials and score are saved in local storage
